# Tests
Simple tests to test the server protocol.

Disclaimer; The permission tests aren't present as these are very hard to test on a local machine with administrator privileges.

## Getting started
1. Open this folder in your ide of choice.
2. Make sure the server `/dropbox/` contents are equal to the `resources` directory.
3. Run the server.
4. Run the test project.
5. Check the console for Errors/Ok's.
